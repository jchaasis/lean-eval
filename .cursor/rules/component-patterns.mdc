# Component Patterns

## Context
Differentiate between server and client components to optimize performance and maintainability. Use Server Components by default, and only use Client Components when interactivity is required.

## Requirements

### Server Components (Default)
- Use Server Components by default for data fetching
- Server Components are async and can directly call Server Actions
- No `"use client"` directive needed

### Client Components
- Only use `"use client"` when needed (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Mark the component with `"use client"` directive at the top

### Component Organization
- Each component should have a JSDoc comment describing its purpose
- Export components from `index.ts` files for cleaner imports
- Use named exports, not default exports for components

### Component Props
- Always define explicit TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Use descriptive prop names

### Reusable Components over raw HTML
- Always prefer reusable Components over raw HTML.
- If a Component doesn't exist for the desired use case, consider adding one.

## Examples

```typescript
// Server Component: Fetches data at build/request time
import { getAbout } from "@/app/actions";

/**
 * About Section Component
 * Displays introduction, core technologies, specialties, achievements, and highlights
 */
export async function AboutSection() {
  const aboutData = await getAbout();
  return (
    <section id="about">
      {/* Component implementation */}
    </section>
  );
}
```

```typescript
// Client Component: Handles user interactions
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import type { Project } from "@/types";

/**
 * Project Card Component
 * Displays project information with image, title, description, technologies, and links
 */
interface ProjectCardProps {
  project: Project;
  onImageClick: (project: Project) => void;
}

export function ProjectCard({ project, onImageClick }: ProjectCardProps) {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  // Component implementation
}
```
